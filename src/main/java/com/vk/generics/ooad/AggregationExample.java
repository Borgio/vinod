		 * Engine engine = new Engine() creates a new Engine object, we are

		 * constructor. After that we are printing engine and bike.getEngine() ,
		 * they are same objects. Now after setting bike = null; we are printing
		 * engine. It still gives same result It means even after we have

		 * From above observations we can note that aggregation is a weak
		 * association and existence of the object does not depend upon
		 * existence of owning object. i.e. Engine still exists without a Bike
